# Image Classification with Machine Learning Models

This repository demonstrates image classification using machine learning models implemented with TensorFlow and a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. The project includes two models: **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)** for general image classification and a **custom-trained CIFAR-10 model** for specific CIFAR-10 dataset classification.

## üöÄ Features

- **MobileNetV2 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)**  
  Classifies a wide range of objects with high accuracy using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.  
- **CIFAR-10 (Custom-trained model)**  
  Recognizes 10 object categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  
- **Interactive Web App**  
  Streamlit-powered interface for image upload, model selection, and classification visualization.
